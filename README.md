# Patagonia-Sustainability-Data-Driven-Business-Analysis-Intro-Project

This was one of my first projects at the beginning of my Data Analysis journey.  
It doesn't include numerical datasets or coding, but it helped me understand what a data-driven approach really means.

I analyzed Patagonia as a sustainable company, focusing on their mission, business model, environmental strategy, and long-term value creation.  
The goal was to practice structured thinking, critical analysis, and insight generation — before moving to technical tools like SQL, Python and Excel.

The project includes:
- A research-based analysis
- Identification of key sustainability drivers
- Evaluation of Patagonia’s data-driven decisions
- A final presentation summarizing insights
